## What we,ve used

- _HTML_

Standard page markup, with an eye on semantic language usage. Made according to [codeguide.co](http://codeguide.co/).

- _CSS_

Mobile first, adaptive design according to [codeguide.co](http://codeguide.co/). No sizes superfixes, floats etc. Did my best for pixel-perfect effect. [Flexboxgrid2](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/flexboxgrid2) implemented.

- JS

Basic EcmaScript6 syntax used. Arrow functions, import/export... (to be continued)

- _React_ 

Page layout was divided into react components. Whole CSS was migrated to JSX-files with styled-components. Project was made with create-react-app, react-helmet, react-responsive and react-intl ... (to be continued)
