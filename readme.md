Our work is in progress now, we're on the second chapter of the course.

## What do we have so far

- Simple html/css layouts for mobile and tablet devices was made
- Used create-react-app for a fast start with react
- The whole structure of the layout is now divided in components, and displaying properly
- Refactoring code for more deep react components understanding*
- Adding styled-components to existing components
- Dividing components to fucnctions
- Defining functional components, how props really work?
- *WE ARE HERE => Desktop layout mock added*

_Next on the go:_
