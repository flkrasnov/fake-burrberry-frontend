# Fake Burberry.com Frontend

This is my study-project for [evgenyrodionov's](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov) course.

***

Our work is in progress now, we're on the second chapter of the course.

## What do we have so far

- simple html/css layouts for mobile and tablet devices was made
- used create-react-app for a fast start with react
- the whole structure of the layout is now divided in components, and displaying properly
- refactoring code for more deep react components understanding*
- Adding styled-components to existing components
- *WE ARE HERE => Dividing components to fucnctions and classes

Next on the go:

- defining functional components, how props really work?
- Desctop mock added
