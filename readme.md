Our work is in progress now, we're on the second chapter of the course.

## What do we have so far

- simple html/css layouts for mobile and tablet devices was made
- used create-react-app for a fast start with react
- the whole structure of the layout is now divided in components, and displaying properly
- *WE ARE HERE => refactoring code for more deep react components understanding*

Next on the go:

- Dividing components to fucnctions and classes
- Adding styled-components to existing components
